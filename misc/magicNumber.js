/* Given a number, sum the square of all the digits and repeat until
   you get the original number again. Return the length of that sequence.
   For instance: magicNumber(16) = 9 because:
     1: 16
     2: 1^2 + 6^2 = 37
     3: 3^2 + 7^2 = 58
     4: 5^2 + 8^2 = 89
     5: 8^2 + 9^2 = 145
     6: 1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 42
     7: 4^2 + 2^2 = 20
     8: 2^2 + 0^2 = 4
     9: 4^2 = 16 */
